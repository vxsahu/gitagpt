## Purpose of Bhagavad Gita AI

Vikas Sahu, a tech-geek entrepreneur, saw the potential of using AI to bring ancient wisdom and spirituality to a modern audience. With this vision in mind, he set out to create GitaGPT, a virtual platform that allows users to have a conversation with Lord Krishna and gain insight and guidance from the teachings of the Bhagavad Geeta.

Utilizing cutting-edge AI technology, Vikas worked tirelessly to develop a system that could understand and respond to users' questions in a natural, intuitive way. The result of his efforts is GitaGPT, a revolutionary tool that is changing the way people connect with spirituality and seek answers to life's questions.

## How works GitaGPT Chatbot

This project uses the [OpenAI GPT-3.5 API](https://openai.com/api/) (specifically, text-davinci-003) and [Vercel Edge functions](https://vercel.com/features/edge-functions) with streaming. It constructs a prompt based on the form and user input, sends it to the GPT-3 API via a Vercel Edge function, then streams the response back to the application.

Video and blog post coming soon on how to build apps with OpenAI and Vercel Edge functions!
